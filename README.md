Android Hybrid (E-Shop)
====================

<b>E-Shop (Electronic Shopping)</b> is a mobile pilot project included in Phresco. In order to show the Frameworkâ€™s potential, 
the E-Shop has been developed by encompassing all the facets offered by Phresco. As the name suggests, 
it is an app with Android compatibility and has been created using Android Native and HTML5. For cross platform reach, 
developers would need to code the native part separately for each platform but they can use the same HTML5 part across all of them.
